# PetVet

PetVet helps pet owners to book an appointment for their pet. Many people have pets in their home and there is no platform available in the market where people can see nearby veterinary doctors. Our platform will enable people to book an appointment with veterinary doctors.
<br/>
Users can also read the blogs & can cancel the appointment through contacting the clinic.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio)
